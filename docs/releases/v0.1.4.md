# qlaw-cli v0.1.4

Date: 2025-11-19

## Added

- Workflow mode with Agent Framework handoff support, streaming via the new bridge backend
- Dedicated Agent Framework settings in the overlay plus `/mode`, `/workflow`, `/agents`, `/run`, `/continue`, `/judge`, `/af-bridge`, and `/af-model` commands
- Python FastAPI bridge (`bridge/bridge_server.py`) that exposes OpenAI-compatible SSE endpoints for multi-tier workflows

## Changed

- Request routing now automatically targets the bridge whenever workflow mode is enabled and AF settings are configured
- Status line, prompts, and message rendering surface workflow state, agent trace summaries, and bridge readiness cues

## Fixed

- Hardened SSE parsing to avoid dropping trace events when the stream flushes trailing bytes
- Storage layer now honors custom data directories and consistently persists workflow artifacts

## Docs

- Added `AGENTS.md`, `docs/API-INTEGRATION.md`, and bridge runbooks covering Agent Framework setup and CLI wiring
