# qlaw-cli v0.1.3

Date: 2025-11-09

## Added
- Fuzzy autocomplete for commands and mentions with rich descriptions
- Interactive prompts overlay for confirmations and input (used by /clear, /model, /endpoint, /api-key)
- New commands: /endpoint, /api-key
- Theme system with light and dark palettes; /theme toggles live
- Streaming spinner indicator and elapsed seconds in status line during responses

## Changed
- Suggestions now come from a central registry and use fuzzy ranking instead of prefix-only filtering
- Introduced settings-backed keybindings for suggestion navigation (↑/↓, Tab) with a structured keymap

## Fixed
- Guarded mention autocomplete selection to avoid undefined access in edge cases

## Docs
- Added WARP.md tailored to this repo
- Added IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for Enhanced Interactivity & Settings
